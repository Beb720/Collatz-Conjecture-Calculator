# Collatz-Conjecture-Calculator

This is a program to calculate and display every step of the Collatz Conjecture in the Python console.

Why? Beacue I thought the idea of this mathmatics problem was intriguing and want to share it a little.
#
# What is the Collatz Conjecture?
The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical conjecture that asks whether repeating two arithmetic operations will eventuall transform every positive integer into 1.

The Collatz Conjecture follows two rules:
1. If the positive integer is odd, then you multiply it by 3 and add 1 ((n*3)+1).
2. If the psoitive integer is even, then you divide it by 2 (n/2).
   
# For example:
let's choose 5 as our number.

5 is odd: (5*3)+1 = 16

16 is even: 16/2 = 8

8 is even: 8/2 = 4

4 is even: 4/2 = 2

2 is even: 2/2 = 1
